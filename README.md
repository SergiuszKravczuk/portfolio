# PORTFOLIO
## About me
I am fascinated by testing and constantly strive to enhance my skills in this field. Alongside my passion for testing, I also enjoy coding and actively work on developing my programming abilities. In my current role, I prioritize precision and accuracy, ensuring that even the smallest details are thoroughly addressed. Moreover, I am a strong advocate for automation and aim to automate as many processes as possible to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

To achieve my goals, I utilize a variety of tools in my work. These include Cypress, Chat GPT, and Postman, which enable me to perform automated testing and streamline the testing process. I am highly proficient in these tools and have achieved reliable and efficient results through their implementation. Additionally, I am also experienced in using TestLink, Excel, and Test Arena, which assist me in managing test cases, organizing test data, and tracking results effectively.

My commitment to precision extends beyond testing activities. I approach my work with meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that every aspect is thoroughly examined and validated. This approach allows me to deliver high-quality results and maintain a rigorous standard of excellence.
